# :bulb: :pencil2: Build a Random Quote Machine 
Quote Machine developed by me as Free Code Camp #1 Intermediate Front End Development Projects


1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/
2. Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. :punch: Figure it out for yourself.
3. Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4. User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
5. User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
6. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
7. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
8. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook. :+1: :+1:
